> Follow your heart.

## Install
OCENCH can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ocench/) using the command:

    pip install ocench


## Running OCENCH
To run OCENCH it is necessary to have installed the libraries listed in the *requirements.txt* file.

After this, we can now execute the two available methods:
- **NCH_train (X, n_projections, l, extend)**: Trains the model with only normal data.
 - Parameters:
   - **X**: training dataset as a numpy array where each row corresponds with a sample and each column with a feature.
   - **n_projections**: Number of random 2D-projections.
   - ***l*** : Maximum edge length allowed in the NCH (Non-Convex Hull). Typical values: 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2.
   - **extend**: Expansion parameter of the NCH. Extend = 0 implies no expansion, while extend > 0 will expand the edges if it's possible). Typical values: 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.
 - Returns:
    - **model**: entire model containing the information about the projection matrices and the ENCHs (Expanded Non-Convex Hulls).


- **NCH_classify (X, model)**: Predicts the class of new (normal and anomalous) data. 
 - Parameters:
   - **X**: test dataset as a numpy array where each row corresponds with a sample and each column with a feature.
   - **model**: Model returned during training.
 - Returns:
    - **labels**: 1-D numpy array containing the predicted labels for the input dataset, where 0 = Normal and 1 = Anomaly.

## Example

from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import pandas as pd
from NCH import *

num_normal_samples = 1000 # Training dataset size (only normal data)
num_abnormal_samples = 10 # Number of anomalies to classify in test
```
# Create a toy dataset using two isotropic Gaussian blobs (one for each class)
X_train, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=num_normal_samples, centers= [(1,1)], n_features=10, cluster_std=1, random_state=0)
X_test_abnormal, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=num_abnormal_samples, centers=[(20,20)], n_features=10, cluster_std=1, random_state=0)
X_test_normal, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=num_abnormal_samples, centers=[(1,1)], n_features=10, cluster_std=1, random_state=0)
Y_train = [0] * num_normal_samples
Y_test_abnormal = [1] * num_abnormal_samples
Y_test_normal = [0] * num_abnormal_samples
X_test = np.concatenate((X_test_normal, X_test_abnormal), axis=0)
Y_test = np.concatenate((Y_test_normal, Y_test_abnormal), axis=0)
model = NCH_train(X=X_train, n_projections=20, l=2, extend=0.3) # Train the model with only normal data
prediction = NCH_classify(X=X_test, model=model) # Predict new (normal and abnormal) data
# [0 = Normal | 1 = Anomaly]
print("Real classes: ", Y_test)
print("Predictions: ", prediction)
```

        abstract = {This paper presents an intuitive, robust and efficient One-Class Classification algorithm. The method developed is called OCENCH (One-class Classification via Expanded Non-Convex Hulls) and bases its operation on the construction of subdivisible and expandable non-convex hulls to represent the target class. The method begins by reducing the dimensionality of the data to two-dimensional spaces using random projections. After that, an iterative process based on Delaunay triangulations is applied to these spaces to obtain simple polygons that characterizes the non-convex shape of the normal class data. In addition, the method subdivides the non-convex hulls to represent separate regions in space if necessary. The method has been evaluated and compared to several main algorithms of the field using real data sets. In contrast to other methods, OCENCH can deal with non-convex and disjointed shapes. Finally, its execution can be carried out in a parallel way, which is interesting to reduce the execution time.}
